This is gsuite tool written in Apps Script for automating the import of data from Google Docs to Google Sheets. You just need to create a Google Doc with tables, then populate those tables in the document with text. This script will then pull the content of those Google Doc tables into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, with each row, column table entry in the Google Doc a separate row, column entry in Google Sheets. You can find your document id or sheet id from the URL of the item - it's the string that follows the 'd/' in the URL.
